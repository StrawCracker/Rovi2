 * being updated automatically in a thread, then it's not certain that a call to getTimeStamp and isMoving will be
 * reading from the same robot state
 * Maybe even pack it into it's own structure with a c++/rw interface/types returned instead of the ROS types.
 * The getQ, getQd, isMoving and getTimeStamp functions could be moved to become member functions of that struct/class.
